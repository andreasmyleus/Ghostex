//! The rows a `shells-running` activity draws: one per background task the agent left running.
//!
//! CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-11 DECISION:
//! User: "1 shell still running" was not clear enough for non-technical users. From the mockups they picked "M3" for every count, also one task: one row per task with its own timer, up to three rows and then "+N more". The card has no heading line: "Still running in the background" sits in an (i) left of each row's timer, a tooltip on hover (desktop) and shown on tap or long-press (phone); this replaces the heading line the card first had, and the reply-finished time that heading once carried. With two or more tasks the card is one folded row in the Threads card's look, "Background tasks" with a muted "2 running" and a chevron, folded by default; unfolding it shows the per-task rows. One task keeps its single row. While a turn runs, the working indicator stays and this card is an extra row above it, never a replacement (see `working_strip`). A row is titled by the description the agent gave the command, a monitor reads "Watching …", and the command itself shows on hover (desktop) or long-press (phone). When a task ends, the chat's existing finished row keeps its look; the user later dropped the duration it first gained ("remove exit code 0 and "after 39s" here ... useless info", see `transcript::noise::split_status_summary`).
//!
//! CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-11 SEE-ALSO:
//! server/src/session_chat_claude_background.rs reads the tasks from Claude's transcript; apps/desktop/src/app/native_chat/working_strip.rs and apps/mobile/app/src/chat/native/cards/WorkingStrip.tsx draw these rows and must match.
