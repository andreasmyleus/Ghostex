//! Catch me up: the composer's button and the card that shows where the session stands.
//!
//! The button asks gxserver (`/api/catchUpSession`) for a short summary of the session's recent
//! transcript, written by the small title-generation agent in the Marked handovers format; the card
//! above the composer shows it loading, then the summary drawn with the transcript's own marked
//! sections, or the refusal in plain words. Every click while the card is closed asks for a fresh
//! summary; Refresh asks again with the card open.
//!
//! CDXC:CatchMeUp 2026-10-11 DECISION:
//! User: a "Catch me up" button in the composer itself, at its top right, that has a smaller, cheaper agent read the session's last messages and shows a popup explaining where the session is, in the coloured marked-handover format, so they can continue quickly after reading it. Off by default; Settings > Chat turns it on (`chatCatchMeUp`), and the button shows only while it is on.
//! CDXC:CatchMeUp 2026-10-11 WHY:
//! The switch reaches the core two ways and the latest wins: the desktop host pushes it with the chat settings (so flipping it shows or hides the button within seconds), and gxserver puts it on every chat read (`catchUp`), which is the only way the phone, which has no settings file, learns it.
//! SEE-ALSO: server/src/session_chat_catch_up.rs (the summary), apps/desktop/src/app/native_chat/catch_up.rs and apps/mobile/app/src/chat/native/cards/CatchUpCard.tsx (drawing), transcript/marked_sections.rs (the colouring).
