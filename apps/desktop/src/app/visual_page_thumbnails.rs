//! Pictures for the chat's page cards, taken from a page the user opened: when the floating page
//! window has loaded a page from this computer's gxserver and the page has no picture yet (or was
//! answered since its picture), the window's own browser takes a screenshot of the top of the page
//! (`CefSurface::capture_page_top`), which is shrunk and encoded off the main thread and stored
//! with the page (`server/src/visual_pages/thumbnail.rs`) for every client's card.
//!
//! CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-11 SEE-ALSO:
//! The user's decision is on server/src/visual_pages/thumbnail.rs; the screenshot is apps/desktop/src/cef/shell/page_screenshot.rs; the window is apps/desktop/src/app/window/visual_page_modal.rs.
