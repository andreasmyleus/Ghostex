//! The coordinator's role: the playbook it runs by, and how it reaches the agent at launch.

/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-09-30 WHY:
/// The role reaches the agent as a system prompt, not as a chat message: a first message scrolls away, is summarised by compaction, and shows in the chat as if the user typed it. The flag lives in the session's saved base command, which resume, fork and account wrapping rebuild from, so it survives all three (the same mechanism as per-session model flags). Dynamic state (goal, instructions, memory, threads) is read through `ghostex coordinator status` instead, because it changes while the session runs.
/// SEE-ALSO: server/src/agents/launch_plan.rs (applies the flags), server/src/ghostex_cli/coordinator/ (the verbs this playbook names).
///
/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-09 DECISION:
/// User: "If a tool call got rejected with ("STOP and wait") just as a thread report arrives then this is Ghostex's delivery Escape, not the owner pausing your work: retry the tool call and carry on." The playbook's "Waiting means ending your turn" section says so.
///
/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-11 DECISION:
/// User: "pls make sure future orchestrators on customers pcs on 10.20.0 would behave like you are behaving now". The playbook's "Asking the user" part has orchestrators ask plain questions as an in-chat ```questions form (all open questions at once, never typed answers or the one-question-at-a-time built-in tool), visual questions as a page, and never resend an answered question.
///
/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-11 DECISION:
/// User: "i should never have to go into a inner thread to see questions or mockups or whatever ... I should only talk to u and you bring what needs my attentino from the threads under you since you're the orchestrator". The playbook's "Everything the user sees comes through you" section has the orchestrator ask a thread's questions and republish its pages from its own session (so answers come back to it), and the thread brief (brief.rs `thread_brief`) tells threads not to ask the user or publish pages themselves.
///
/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-12 DECISION:
/// User: "when you say 'In progress' but don't share all of the actual in progress tasks this isn't nice because it makes me think some tasks aren't running when they actually are running", and for the threads started this turn: "let's call it 'Kicked off'". Then (2026-10-12), on a thread listed under both: "let's not share same update in 2 places pls". The playbook's "Talking to the user" section has a handover list the threads started this turn under 🛫 Kicked off and every other thread still working (from `ghostex orchestrator status`) under 🔄 In progress, so each running thread appears exactly once. Supersedes the 2026-10-11 wording that listed every working thread under In progress.
///
/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-10 DECISION:
/// User: "let's please rename "Coordinator" to "Orchestrator" everywhere so it's clearer to everyone." The playbook and the guide pointer call the role an orchestrator and name `ghostex orchestrator` verbs; the role file's name on disk and every internal name keep "coordinator".

/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-06 WHY:
/// Empryo 3.9.0-beta's interactive app reads neither `--agent` nor `--system` (its argv parser returns early without `--headless`) and ignores hook `additionalContext`, so a launch flag cannot carry the role. The role spike (card agent-bo-95422941) proved the TUI's `/agent <name>` command does: the profile's body joins the tab's system prompt (35,520 to 44,990 characters), and the tab keeps it across `--session` resume. So gxserver writes the playbook as the global profile `~/.empryo/agents/ghostex-coordinator.md` and queues `/agent ghostex-coordinator` once, at create and at promote.
